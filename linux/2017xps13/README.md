My linux configs

One script: setup.sh. It sets up the system environment just how I like it

Everything is documented in the script itself. I try to avoid globbing in the script, so that it's clear _exactly_ what's being done... since the most likely use case is running it step by step, by hand, the next time I get a new computer.

Separately there is an .ics file, a solarized dark color scheme for PHPStorm that's been customized with higher contrast per https://github.com/bmaupin/solarized-dark-high-contrast/blob/master/solarized-dark-high-contrast.py
